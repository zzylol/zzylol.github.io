I am a 5th-year PhD student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Alan (Zaoxing) Liu](https://zaoxing.github.io/). My research interests are broadly in systems and networking. In particular, I attempt to bridge the gap between approximate algorithms (e.g., sampling, sketches) and practical computing systems, aiming to improve query performance and system scalability. Currently, I'm working on scalable cloud telemetry systems. 

I received my B.E. for Computer Science from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021.
