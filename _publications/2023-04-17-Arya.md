summary: >-
  Arya introduces a decomposition-based sampling framework that supports interactive mining of arbitrary subgraph patterns on production-scale graphs.
  The system decomposes complex pattern queries into reusable sampling plans that deliver unbiased estimates with theoretical accuracy guarantees and low latency.
  Experiments on industry workloads show that Arya answers complex pattern queries orders of magnitude faster than prior motif enumeration systems while retaining accuracy.

Arya presents a sampling-based system that enables on-demand mining of rich graph patterns on massive real-world datasets. The paper details the decomposition-based sampling strategy, accuracy analysis, and engineering techniques that make the system practical for production use.
